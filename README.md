# Exploiting convolution neural network features along with hand crafted features in SVM.

# Preprocessing
We use SemEval 2013 dataset in our experiment. After tokenizing tweets with [ark-tweet-nlp][1], we replace Numerics, URLs, User mentions and Punctuations with NUM, URL, USR and PUN respectively. You can download the preprocessed tweets.
